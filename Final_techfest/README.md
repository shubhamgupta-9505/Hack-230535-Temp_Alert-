# Temprature Alert

Our given project asks user about there preferred location and their preffered range of temprature (ie.maximum temprature and min temprature), and from the above information it checks real time temprature data(via. openweather API <https://openweathermap.org/>)
and gives alert to user if there temprature exceed maximum temprature or it get decreased by min temprature.

## Files(description)
### Files used
#### Backend files:-
1. temprature.py->(It is the main backend file on which the program runs. It is the backbone of the program. Here all Agents are been stored and runs according to the requirements)

2. storage.py->(It is a bucket file which stores the input values fromt the user.)

#### Frontend files:-
1. finallogin.py->(It is the login page created by pyhton GUI. Which basically asks for some entries Username,location,maximum temprature, minimum temprature)

2. inside.py->(This page is the main GUI page, which gives output of alert notification to the user checking out the backend file of temprature.py)

#### Data Files:-
1. pyproject.toml->(It carries some version and uagent information of the project)

2. .env-> (It carries the weather_api_key, which is a private key and we cant openly present it.)

3. gitignore.txt->(it makes the env file not visible publically)

4. poetry.lock->(This file is automatically @generated by Poetry 1.6.1)

5. private_json.keys->(This is automatically generated to remove API key)


## Demo

To run our demo, you need to prepare temprature_Alert checkpoints locally. Please follow the instructions here to download the checkpoints.

1. We are working on uagents library.
2. Install the given packages on installation section on your python environment.
3. User will firstly Run our finallogin.py file. It will ask for the follwing values:-
* Username
* Location
* Maximum Temprature 
* Minimum Temprature
4. After filling out the asked information user has to click the Run button. Which will redirect user to the Main fucntioning page (ie. inside.py)
5. As the inside.py function runs it will show certain frames.
* frame1=> Give out  the location, maximum and minimum temprature entered by the user.
* frame2=> It includes a clock which has a time period of 30 mins. which means after 30 mins the program will be rerun automatically fetching out the new data and outputing it on the screen.
* frame3=> It is a notification frame which runs the Agents which our created from uagents library. This is the frame which will deliver out the terminal output on the GUI.
* frame4=> This frame includes advanced information about the climate ie. humidity, air pressure etc. This will also change according to the clock.
6. After coming to redirected page user is supposed to click start alert button, and th clock will start and user will start getting information according to the openeather API data.
7. To exit the code user can click the exit button which will stop the program for further operations.
